#         Machine Learning - Titanic Disaster           #
#-------------------------------------------------------#

PROBLEM: Perform analysis using Machine Learning to predict what sorts of people and which passengers survived the sinking of Titanic in 1912.

DATASET: For every passenger various important attributes like age, gender, passenger fare, booking class and other related information is provided. In addition few records are included in the training dataset (train.csv), which also indicates whether that passenger survived the sinking or not. Using the attributes in the training data, the survival criteria is determined which is tested against the records in the testing dataset (test.csv). The output (titanic_test.csv) contained the passenger data along with an indicator of whether or not he/she survived.

- Testing Dataset: test.csv
- Training Dataset: train.csv
- Results: titanic_test.csv

SOLUTION: Please read the comments on the top of each python file for more details on what that particular program does.

IMPLEMENTATION: Step 1: python titanic_train.py
				Step 2: python titanic_test.py

Percentage of passengers correctly predicted: 0.77512
